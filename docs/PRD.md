## Personal Training Session Management System

### 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** PT Session Tracker

**Purpose:** Replace the paper-based session tracking system with a digital solution that streamlines session validation, eliminates manual data entry, and automates payroll calculations for personal trainers.

**Key Problem:** Currently, trainers log sessions on paper, manually transfer to Excel with photos, and HR must aggregate all data to calculate monthly execution commissions. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to audit.

**Solution:** A web-based, mobile-friendly application that digitally tracks sessions, validates completion via email confirmation, and automatically calculates commission payouts based on tiered percentages and session values.

### 2. Core User Stories & Objectives
