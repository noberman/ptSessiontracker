- They serve < 20% of users
- They require significant technical investment
- They depend on external factors (partnerships, regulations)
- They're "nice to have" but not business critical

Features graduate from here when:
- Multiple customers request them
- They become competitive necessities
- Technical prerequisites are met
- Resources become available
- Clear ROI is demonstrated
