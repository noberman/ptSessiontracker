## üöÄ Priority Order for SaaS MVP

### Phase 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation (Critical)
Based on `/docs/SAAS_MVP_PLAN.md`, we need NEW tasks for:
1. **NEW: Organization model implementation**
2. **NEW: Multi-tenant data isolation**
3. **NEW: Organization-specific package types**
4. **UPDATE: 11-location-management.md** - Add organization context

### Phase 2: Core Features Completion
1. **07-commission-system.md** - Implement flexible commission per `/docs/COMMISSION_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
2. **09b-payroll-exports.md** - Excel/CSV export for payroll
3. **06c-session-management.md** - Session history and management

### Phase 3: Onboarding & Growth
1. **14-saas-onboarding.md** - Complete onboarding flow from landing page
2. **15-cancellation-flow.md** - Retention and cancellation handling
3. **NEW: Stripe subscription integration**
4. **NEW: Organization settings page**
5. **NEW: Invite system for users**

### Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement
1. **08b-email-workflows.md** - Automated notifications
2. **10-admin-features.md** - Advanced configuration
3. **13-bulk-import.md** - Enhanced import features
4. Complete remaining items in partial tasks

## üìù Archived/Outdated Tasks
- **12-onboarding-mvp.md** ‚Üí Moved to archive (Wood Square's original migration plan)
- Replaced by **14-saas-onboarding.md** for new SaaS customers

## üìù Tasks Needing Updates  
- All remaining tasks need `organizationId` context added for multi-tenant

## üìä Overall Progress
- **Original MVP**: ~85% complete (higher than previously thought!)
- **SaaS Transformation**: ~0% started
- **Commission System**: Fully designed but not implemented
- **Multi-tenant**: Schema changes not started

## Next Steps
1. Create new task files for SaaS transformation based on SAAS_MVP_PLAN.md
2. Update existing task files to include organization context
3. Prioritize commission system implementation (highly documented, ready to build)
4. Focus on multi-tenant isolation before adding new features
