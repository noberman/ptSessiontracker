# Task 02: Authentication System

**Complexity: 5/10**  
**Priority: CORE (MVP)**  
**Status: Not Started**  
**Dependencies: Task 01 (Foundation)**

## Objective
Implement secure authentication system with role-based access control for trainers, managers, and administrators.

## Requirements from PRD
- Secure login for trainers, managers, and admin
- Role-based access (TRAINER, CLUB_MANAGER, PT_MANAGER, ADMIN)
- Session management
- Mobile-responsive login interface

## Implementation Checklist

### Authentication Pages
- [ ] Create login page (`/login`)
- [ ] Create logout functionality
- [ ] Add loading states during authentication
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

### NextAuth Configuration
- [ ] Configure credentials provider
- [ ] Set up JWT strategy
- [ ] Implement session callbacks with role data
- [ ] Add protected API route wrapper
- [ ] Configure redirect URLs

### Middleware & Protection
- [ ] Create authentication middleware
- [ ] Implement role-based route protection
- [ ] Add API route authentication
- [ ] Handle unauthorized access redirects
- [ ] Create permission helper functions

### Session Management
- [ ] Include user role in session
- [ ] Include location data in session
- [ ] Set appropriate session expiry
- [ ] Handle session refresh
- [ ] Add "Remember me" functionality (optional)

### Security Features
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Secure password comparison
- [ ] Audit log for login attempts
- [ ] Session invalidation on password change

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can log in with email/password
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Unauthorized users redirected to login
- [ ] Role included in session data
- [ ] Logout clears session completely

## Technical Notes
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (already in schema)
- Implement proper TypeScript types for session
- Consider adding password reset flow in Phase 2
- Log all authentication events to audit table
