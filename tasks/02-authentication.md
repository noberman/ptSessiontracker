# Task 02: Authentication System

**Complexity: 5/10**  
**Priority: CORE (MVP)**  
**Status: âœ… COMPLETE**  
**Dependencies: Task 01 (Foundation)**

## Objective
Implement secure authentication system with role-based access control for trainers, managers, and administrators.

## Requirements from PRD
- Secure login for trainers, managers, and admin
- Role-based access (TRAINER, CLUB_MANAGER, PT_MANAGER, ADMIN)
- Session management
- Mobile-responsive login interface

## Implementation Checklist

### Authentication Pages
- [x] Create login page (`/login`)
- [x] Create logout functionality
- [x] Add loading states during authentication
- [x] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [x] Mobile-responsive design

### NextAuth Configuration
- [x] Configure credentials provider
- [x] Set up JWT strategy
- [x] Implement session callbacks with role data
- [x] Add protected API route wrapper
- [x] Configure redirect URLs

### Middleware & Protection
- [x] Create authentication middleware
- [x] Implement role-based route protection
- [x] Add API route authentication
- [x] Handle unauthorized access redirects
- [x] Create permission helper functions

### Session Management
- [x] Include user role in session
- [x] Include location data in session
- [x] Set appropriate session expiry
- [x] Handle session refresh
- [ ] Add "Remember me" functionality (optional)

### Security Features
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [x] Secure password comparison
- [ ] Audit log for login attempts
- [ ] Session invalidation on password change

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Users can log in with email/password
- [x] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [x] Session persists across page refreshes
- [x] Unauthorized users redirected to login
- [x] Role included in session data
- [x] Logout clears session completely

## Technical Notes
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (already in schema)
- Implement proper TypeScript types for session
- Consider adding password reset flow in Phase 2
- Log all authentication events to audit table
