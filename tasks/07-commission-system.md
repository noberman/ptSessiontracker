# Task 07: Commission System

**Complexity: 4/10**  
**Priority: ENHANCEMENT (Phase 2)**  
**Status: Not Started**  
**Dependencies: Task 06C (Session Management)**

## Objective
Implement simplified commission tracking system that counts validated sessions and calculates total session values for HR to apply commission percentages.

## Requirements from PRD
- Count validated sessions per trainer per month
- Calculate total session value
- Only validated sessions count
- No-shows excluded
- Monthly reset
- HR applies commission percentages externally

## Implementation Checklist

### Commission API
- [ ] GET `/api/commission/summary` - Monthly summary
- [ ] GET `/api/commission/trainer/[id]` - Trainer details
- [ ] GET `/api/commission/period` - Custom date range
- [ ] Export endpoints for HR

### Monthly Summary Calculation
- [ ] Count validated sessions per trainer
- [ ] Sum session values per trainer
- [ ] Group by calendar month
- [ ] Exclude cancelled sessions
- [ ] Exclude no-shows
- [ ] Include substitute sessions

### Commission Dashboard
- [ ] Monthly summary table:
  - [ ] Trainer name
  - [ ] Total sessions completed
  - [ ] Total session value
  - [ ] Validation rate
  - [ ] Month-to-date progress
- [ ] Filter by month/year
- [ ] Filter by location
- [ ] Comparison with previous month

### Trainer View
- [ ] Personal commission summary
- [ ] Session count for current month
- [ ] Running total of session values
- [ ] List of validated sessions
- [ ] Progress toward next tier (if tiers configured)

### Data Export for HR
- [ ] Export to Excel/CSV format
- [ ] Include all necessary fields:
  - [ ] Trainer ID and name
  - [ ] Period (month/year)
  - [ ] Session count
  - [ ] Total value
  - [ ] Location
- [ ] Scheduled monthly reports
- [ ] Email delivery option

### Period Management
- [ ] Define commission period (calendar month)
- [ ] Handle month boundaries correctly
- [ ] Historical period access
- [ ] Year-end summaries
- [ ] Fiscal year option (if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurate session counts per trainer
- [ ] Only validated sessions included
- [ ] Monthly totals calculate correctly
- [ ] Export format compatible with Excel
- [ ] Historical data accessible
- [ ] Real-time updates as sessions validate

## Technical Notes
- Use database aggregation for performance
- Cache monthly summaries
- Consider materialized views for reports
- UTC timezone for consistency
- Index sessions by trainer, date, validation

## Commission Calculation Example
```
Trainer: John Smith
Month: December 2024

Validated Sessions: 45
Total Session Value: $4,500

Commission Tier Achieved: 31-60 sessions = 30% rate
Commission Due: $1,350 (30% Ã— $4,500)

Note: The 30% rate applies to ALL 45 sessions, not just sessions 31-45
```

## Report Format
```csv
Trainer Name,Location,Month,Sessions,Total Value
John Smith,Main Gym,2024-12,45,4500.00
Jane Doe,West Branch,2024-12,38,3800.00
```
