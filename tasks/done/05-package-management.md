# Task 05: Package Management

**Complexity: 4/10**  
**Priority: ENHANCEMENT (Phase 2)**  
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**  
**Dependencies: Task 04 (Client Management)**

## Objective
Implement package management system for tracking client training packages, session values, and remaining sessions.

## Requirements from PRD
- Define package types (e.g., "12 sessions for $1,200")
- Calculate per-session value automatically
- Link packages to clients
- Track remaining sessions (display only, not blocking)

## Implementation Checklist

### Package CRUD Operations
- [x] GET `/api/packages` - List all packages
- [x] GET `/api/packages/[id]` - Get package details
- [x] POST `/api/packages` - Create new package
- [x] PUT `/api/packages/[id]` - Update package
- [x] DELETE `/api/packages/[id]` - Soft delete

### Package Creation Form
- [x] Package name/description
- [x] Total package value ($)
- [x] Total number of sessions
- [x] Auto-calculate per-session value
- [x] Client selection dropdown
- [x] Active status toggle
- [x] Start date (optional)
- [x] Expiry date (optional)

### Package List View
- [x] Table with package information
- [x] Filter by client
- [x] Filter by active status
- [x] Show sessions used/remaining
- [x] Show total value and per-session value
- [x] Sort by client, value, sessions

### Client Package Assignment
- [x] Assign package to client
- [x] Multiple packages per client allowed
- [x] Set primary/active package
- [x] Package history for client
- [ ] Transfer package between clients

### Session Tracking
- [x] Count sessions used per package
- [x] Calculate remaining sessions
- [x] Display progress bar/indicator
- [x] Warning when package near completion
- [x] Report on expired packages

### Package Analytics
- [ ] Average package value
- [ ] Most popular package types
- [ ] Package completion rates
- [ ] Revenue per package type
- [ ] Unused session value

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Packages created with auto-calculated session value
- [x] Multiple packages can be assigned to one client
- [x] Session count updates when sessions logged
- [x] Remaining sessions displayed accurately
- [x] Expired packages marked appropriately
- [x] Package history preserved when deleted

## Technical Notes
- Session value = Total Value ÷ Total Sessions
- Don't block session creation if package exceeded
- Consider package templates for common types
- Track package modifications in audit log
- Index by client_id for performance

## Common Package Examples
```
- Starter: 5 sessions for $500 ($100/session)
- Standard: 12 sessions for $1,200 ($100/session)
- Premium: 24 sessions for $2,160 ($90/session)
- Elite: 50 sessions for $4,000 ($80/session)
```
