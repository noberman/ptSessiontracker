# Task 12: Onboarding & Go-Live Process

**Complexity: 7/10**  
**Priority: CRITICAL**  
**Timeline: September 2024 (Setup) ‚Üí October 2024 (Go-Live)**  
**Status: Planning Phase**

## Objective
Successfully migrate from paper-based signature system to digital PT Session Tracker with minimal disruption to operations.

## Timeline Overview
- **September 2024**: Data migration, account setup, parallel running
- **End September**: Final adjustments, data reconciliation
- **October 1, 2024**: Full go-live, deprecate paper system
- **October 31, 2024**: First digital-only payroll run

## Key Considerations & Brainstorm

### üîê Account Provisioning
**Challenges:**
- Need to create accounts for different role hierarchies
- Trainers might not have corporate emails
- Password management and initial login process
- Ensuring correct location assignments

**Potential Features Needed:**
- [ ] Bulk user creation tool (CSV upload for trainers)
- [ ] Welcome email with setup instructions
- [ ] Password reset flow that works with personal emails
- [ ] Temporary passwords with forced reset on first login
- [ ] Account verification process
- [ ] Role assignment validation

### üìä Data Migration
**Challenges:**
- Existing clients in various formats (Excel, paper, other systems)
- Active packages with partially used sessions
- Historical session data (how much to import?)
- Data quality issues (duplicates, missing emails, typos)
- Mapping trainers to clients

**Potential Features Needed:**
- [ ] Client bulk import with duplicate detection
- [ ] Package import with remaining session counts
- [ ] "Opening balance" concept for packages
- [ ] Data validation reports before import
- [ ] Rollback capability if import fails
- [ ] Import preview/dry-run mode
- [ ] Manual override for edge cases

### üîÑ Parallel Running Period (September)
**Challenges:**
- System needs to track NEW sessions only
- Old sessions still on paper for September payroll
- Avoiding double-entry confusion
- Clear cutoff date/time

**Potential Features Needed:**
- [ ] "Effective date" setting for go-live
- [ ] Clear labeling of "pre-digital" vs "digital" sessions
- [ ] September-only view filters
- [ ] Ability to mark sessions as "paper-tracked" vs "digital"
- [ ] Reconciliation reports comparing both systems
- [ ] Training mode/sandbox for practice

### üí∞ Package Migration Strategy
**Critical Questions:**
- How to handle partially-used packages?
- What about expired packages with remaining sessions?
- Package history - how much matters?
- Different package types across locations?

**Potential Approaches:**
1. **Snapshot Method**: Import packages as-is with current remaining counts
2. **Historical Method**: Import all packages with full history
3. **Hybrid Method**: Active packages only + summary stats

**Features Needed:**
- [ ] Package import with custom remaining sessions
- [ ] "Migrated" flag to distinguish from new packages
- [ ] Bulk package creation by client
- [ ] Package templates for common types

### üë• Training & Adoption
**Challenges:**
- Trainers with varying tech skills
- Resistance to change from paper
- Mobile-first for trainers (many won't use desktop)
- Language barriers?

**Potential Features Needed:**
- [ ] In-app guided tour/onboarding
- [ ] Video tutorials linked from dashboard
- [ ] "Practice mode" with fake data
- [ ] Quick reference cards (printable)
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Support ticket system or help chat

### üì± Day One Readiness
**Critical for October 1:**
- All trainers can log in
- All active clients are in system
- All active packages are loaded
- Session creation works flawlessly
- Validation emails sending properly
- Managers can see their dashboards

**Backup Plans Needed:**
- [ ] Manual session entry for technical issues
- [ ] Offline mode or backup process
- [ ] Paper backup forms (just in case)
- [ ] Escalation process for issues
- [ ] Admin override capabilities

### üîç Data Validation & Reconciliation
**End of September Checklist:**
- Compare client counts: Old system vs New
- Verify package totals match
- Check trainer assignments
- Validate email addresses work
- Test validation flow with real clients
- Ensure location data is correct

**Features Needed:**
- [ ] Reconciliation dashboard
- [ ] Data quality reports
- [ ] Missing data alerts
- [ ] Bulk edit tools for corrections
- [ ] Export for manual review

### üìà Success Metrics
**How do we measure successful adoption?**
- Session creation time (should be < 30 seconds)
- Validation rate (target > 80% in first month)
- Support tickets (decreasing trend)
- Trainer login frequency
- Data accuracy vs paper system

**Features Needed:**
- [ ] Adoption dashboard for admin
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics

### üö® Risk Mitigation
**What could go wrong?**
1. **Mass login failures** ‚Üí Need password reset at scale
2. **Email delivery issues** ‚Üí Backup validation method
3. **Data loss** ‚Üí Automated backups, audit trail
4. **Trainer rebellion** ‚Üí Champions program, incentives
5. **Client confusion** ‚Üí Clear communication plan

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Tools (Early September)
1. Build bulk user import tool
2. Create client/package import system
3. Add data validation reports
4. Set up training environment

### Phase 2: Data Migration (Mid-September)
1. Import admin/manager accounts
2. Managers import trainer accounts
3. Import all active clients
4. Import active packages with remaining sessions
5. Verify all data

### Phase 3: Parallel Running (Late September)
1. Trainers start logging NEW sessions only
2. Keep paper system for reference
3. Daily reconciliation checks
4. Gather feedback, fix issues

### Phase 4: Cutover (October 1)
1. Official go-live announcement
2. Disable "test mode" flags
3. Full production use
4. Monitor closely for first week

## Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Historical Data**: How many months of history to import (if any)?
2. **Package Strategy**: How to handle partially-used packages?
3. **Email Requirements**: Can all clients provide email addresses?
4. **Training Approach**: In-person, video, or self-service?
5. **Support Model**: Who handles questions during transition?
6. **Rollback Plan**: What if October 1 fails?

## MVP Features for September

### Must Have:
- Bulk user creation
- Client import with validation
- Package import with remaining sessions
- Clear "migration" labeling
- Basic reconciliation reports

### Nice to Have:
- Automated welcome emails
- In-app tutorials
- Practice mode
- Historical data import

### Can Wait:
- Advanced analytics
- Commission calculations (October payroll)
- Automated reminders
- Complex reports

## Questions to Answer

1. How many total clients need importing?
2. How many active packages?
3. Average sessions per trainer per day?
4. Current validation rate on paper?
5. How tech-savvy are the trainers?
6. What's the current paper process exactly?
7. Who are the champions who can help?

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with stakeholders
2. Decide on critical questions above
3. Prioritize MVP features
4. Build import tools first
5. Create training materials
6. Set up support process
